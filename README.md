## Getting Started 🚀

To set up the Vet Clinic Database on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install PostgreSQL:** If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, download and install it on your system. You can find installation instructions for your specific platform on the [PostgreSQL official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. **Create the Database:** After installing PostgreSQL, create a new database. You can use a PostgreSQL client or the command line to do this. For example, you can use the command:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE vet_clinic;
   ```

3. **Create Tables:** Use the [schema.sql](./schema.sql) script to create all the necessary tables in your newly created database. You can execute the script using a PostgreSQL client or the command line:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d vet_clinic -a -f schema.sql
   ```

4. **Populate Data:** Use the [data.sql](./data.sql) script to populate the tables with sample data:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d vet_clinic -a -f data.sql
   ```

5. **Example Queries:** Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on the newly created database.
    > Please note that this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly.

Now, your local environment should be set up with the Vet Clinic Database, and you're ready to explore and use it for your veterinary clinic management needs.
